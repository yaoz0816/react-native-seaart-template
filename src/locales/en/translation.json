  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_1Q": "What SVIP plans does SeaArt offer?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_1A": "SeaArt offers four SVIP plans: Beginner, Standard, Professional, and Master. Each version grants different privileges. The detailed information can be viewed on the Mall page.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_2Q": "I've already subscribed to a monthly plan. Can I purchase other plans?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_2A": "Yes, you can purchase other plans. There are two scenarios:\\n1. Purchasing an annual plan of the same tier or a higher-tier annual/monthly plan. This will be treated as a subscription upgrade, and the upgraded privileges will take effect immediately.\\n2. Purchasing a monthly plan of the same tier. This will be treated as a one-time purchase. The newly purchased privileges will automatically take effect after your current subscription ends.\\nNote: Downgrading subscriptions is currently not supported. If you need to switch to a lower-tier plan, you can cancel your existing subscription and then purchase the desired plan.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_3Q": "I've already subscribed to an annual plan. Can I purchase other plans?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_3A": "Yes, you can purchase other plans. There are two scenarios:\\n1. Purchasing a higher-tier annual plan. This will be treated as a subscription upgrade, and the upgraded privileges will take effect immediately.\\n2. Purchasing an annual plan of the same tier. This will be treated as a one-time purchase. The newly purchased privileges will automatically take effect after your current subscription ends. \\nNote: Downgrading subscriptions is currently not supported. If you need to switch to a lower-tier plan, you can cancel your existing subscription and then purchase the desired plan.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_4Q": "I've canceled my subscription but the privileges are still active. Can I purchase a new plan?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_4A": "Yes, you can purchase any tier of annual or monthly SVIP plan. The new subscription will take effect immediately. After the new subscription expires, the system will automatically activate the remaining days from your original subscription. If you purchase a one-time monthly or annual plan, the remaining days from your original subscription will take priority, and the newly subscribed privileges will be automatically activated once those days are used up.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_5Q": "What's the difference between a subscription upgrade and a one-time purchase?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_5A": "A subscription upgrade means paying the difference to elevate the remaining period of your current active SVIP privileges to a higher tier, taking effect immediately and replacing the original subscription. Purchasing the same tier of privileges is a one-time purchase, which takes effect after the current subscription period ends and does not affect existing services.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_6Q": "How do I cancel my subscription?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_6A": "If you subscribed to SVIP through Apple Pay or Google Pay, please log in to the respective payment platform to cancel your subscription. iOS device users should go to the App Store, while Android device users should go to Google Play for related operations. SeaArt only provides access to subscription services offered by third-party payment platforms and does not directly participate in the subscription management process. The specific cancellation procedures and results must follow the operating rules and management policies of the respective third-party platform. If you encounter any issues, please consult the customer service team of the respective payment platform for timely and professional assistance.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_7Q": "Do SeaArt's SVIP prices include tax? Can I get an invoice?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_7A": "SeaArt's SVIP prices are all exclusive of tax. If you need an invoice, please send your account ID, payment record (such as a screenshot or SeaArt order number), and billing information (individual/company name, tax number, etc.) to financial@haiyi.art. We will send you an electronic invoice via email within 7 working days.",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_8Q": "What is a guest account? If I purchased SVIP privileges while in guest status, how can I use them on other devices?",
  "SVIP_Purchase_FAQ_8A": "A guest account is a type of account that allows temporary access to certain features of the platform without registration. It protects user privacy while enabling users to experience the service before creating a formal account. If you purchased SVIP privileges while in guest status, you can retain and use these privileges on other devices or the SeaArt webpage through the following steps:\\n1.In your current guest status, choose to log in using a Google, Facebook, or Discord account (make sure the chosen account hasn't been registered on the SeaArt platform before).\\n2.This operation will automatically link your guest account to the selected third-party account.\\n3.Once linked, you can log in through this account on any device or the SeaArt webpage.\\n4.Once logged in, you'll be able to access and use the SVIP privileges you previously purchased.",
